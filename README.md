# password-generator
Description:

The objective of this project was to create a password generator application.

Using this application, one can generate a random password based on the criteria that they have chosen.

Pseudo coding was very useful in the planning of this project.

It was a challenging project and I encountered some errors but my instructor's class lesson on this topic was very helpful in making me understand what was required to be done and how to apply the methods.
