Password-generator

Description:

The objective of this project is to create a password-generating application.

This application uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure the randomness and security of generated passwords.

This application is a simple command-line tool that enables one to generate a random password, which is strong and secure. The password that one gets is based on the criteria that they have chosen in the prompts.

I applied pseudo-coding to the planning and preparation of this project and it was helpful in making me to understand what was required to be done and what steps to follow.

It was a challenging project and I encountered some difficulties but I got some tips and hints from my tutors on this topic, which helped to solve it.

The URL of the application: https://cnwanneka.github.io/password-generator/
