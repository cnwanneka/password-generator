Password-generator

Description:

The objective of this project is to create a password-generating application.

This application uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure the randomness and security of generated passwords.

This application is a simple command-line tool that enables one to generate a random password, that is strong and secure. ThE password that one receives is based on the criteria that they have chosen.

I applied pseudo-coding in the planning and preparation of this project and it was useful.

It was a challenging project and I encountered some difficulties but I got some hints from my class lessons on this topic. This was very helpful in making me understand what was required to be done and how to apply the methods.
