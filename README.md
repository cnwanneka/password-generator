Password-generator

Description:

The objective of this project is to create a password generating application.

This is a simple command-line tool that helps one to generate a random password that is strong and secure. ThE password that one receives is based on the criteria that they have chosen.

Pseudo coding was very useful in the planning of this project.

It was a challenging project and I encountered some errors but my class lesson on this topic was very helpful in making me understand what was required to be done and how to apply the methods.
